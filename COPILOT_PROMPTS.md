# GitHub Copilot Prompts Used

This document tracks all the prompts used with GitHub Copilot during the development of the Parking Lot Management System project, as requested for the interview assignment.

## Initial Setup

### 1. Project Setup
**Prompt**: "Hello this is a new java project which has been assigned by interviewer. I am allowed to take the help of github copilot. I have also asked to notedown all the prompt that I am using to deliver this project. I will provide the requirements soon. Could you please setup a standard java maven project, please?"

**Purpose**: Initial project scaffolding and Maven setup
**Result**: Created standard Maven directory structure, pom.xml, basic classes, and project documentation

### 2. Requirements Analysis
**Prompt**: "Don't start implementing the solution until I ask so. Your job is to understand the requirements. Then, deliverables. I am going to provide you series of information below..."

**Purpose**: Understanding the parking lot management system requirements before implementation
**Result**: Comprehensive analysis of requirements, parking rules, and deliverables

### 3. Implementation Go-Ahead
**Prompt**: "Proceed please"

**Purpose**: Begin implementation after requirements analysis
**Result**: Full implementation of the parking lot management system with all required features

## Additional Prompts

### 4. Requirement Clarification
**Prompt**: "One of the requirement is Parking Lot should take the number of rows as the input parameter. then, for each row the sequence of spot types for each row, the (e.g., [REGULAR, REGULAR, COMPACT]). Then, Instantiate the lot and assign a unique identifier to each spot. Have you taken care of the above requirements?"

**Purpose**: Verify that the constructor implementation matches the specific requirement format
**Result**: Confirmed that the implementation correctly handles row configurations and space identifiers

### 5. Project Organization
**Prompt**: "Could you please add gitignore file?"

**Purpose**: Add proper version control exclusions for Java/Maven project
**Result**: Comprehensive .gitignore file covering Java, Maven, IDEs, and OS-specific files

### 6. Documentation Organization
**Prompt**: "Can you please remove the GitHub Copilot Prompts Used from the readme and put it in a separate file?"

**Purpose**: Clean up README by separating prompt documentation into dedicated file
**Result**: This dedicated COPILOT_PROMPTS.md file

### 7. Strategy Pattern Implementation
**Prompt**: "I think "Strategy Pattern" would be really helpful for allocation. Could you please update the code and implement strategy pattern?"

**Purpose**: Refactor the allocation logic to use Strategy Pattern for better extensibility and maintainability
**Result**: Complete refactoring with strategy interface, concrete strategies for each vehicle type, factory pattern, and comprehensive tests

## Architecture Documentation

### 8. Architectural Diagram Request - Elegant Drawer Format
**Prompt**: "Context: Architectural diagram generation for parking lot management system using elegant-drawer syntax format..."

**Purpose**: Generate architectural diagrams using specific elegant-drawer syntax format
**Result**: Five diagram types created (class, sequence, usecase, flow, mindmap) in elegant-drawer format

### 9. Diagram Format Example and Request
**Prompt**: "Below is the example of class diagram code: [provided elegant-drawer class diagram example for Library Management System]"

**Purpose**: Show preferred diagram syntax format for generating parking lot system diagrams
**Result**: All five architectural diagrams generated using elegant-drawer syntax format

### 10. PlantUML Format Request
**Prompt**: "Please generate all the diagram codes in the plantuml format. Override the existing files."

**Purpose**: Convert all diagrams from elegant-drawer format to standard PlantUML format
**Result**: All five diagrams converted to PlantUML format with proper syntax

### 11. Activity Diagram Syntax Fix
**Prompt**: "Activtity diagram-throws error. Syntax error"

**Purpose**: Fix PlantUML syntax errors in the activity diagram
**Result**: Corrected PlantUML activity diagram with proper if/elseif/else structure instead of unsupported switch statement

## Documentation Enhancement

### 12. README Enhancement Request
**Prompt**: "Could you please update the Readme file in light of below requirements? Setup instructions. ■ A description of your design and the reasoning behind it. ■ Any assumptions you made about the requirements. ■ Notes on limitations and possible extensions you would add with more time."

**Purpose**: Enhance README with comprehensive documentation covering all specified requirements
**Result**: Complete README rewrite with detailed sections on setup, design philosophy, assumptions, and future extensions

### 13. Architecture Diagram Integration
**Prompt**: "Could you please enhance the README section with architecture diagram which are there in the design folder?"

**Purpose**: Add visual architecture documentation to README referencing diagrams in design folder
**Result**: New Architecture Overview section with embedded diagram references and detailed explanations

### 14. Prompt Documentation Update
**Prompt**: "can you please update COPILOT_PROMPTS.md with all the prompt that I have used."

**Purpose**: Update the prompt documentation file with all conversation prompts
**Result**: This comprehensive update to COPILOT_PROMPTS.md
